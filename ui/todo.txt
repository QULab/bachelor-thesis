pre-processing:
• pre-process server-side, store results in db
• "automatization": input texts, output data in DB format (to be uploaded manually)
    - make input data format more general / easier to replicate
    - figure out how to make this available for other people (npm script? -> add to /ui?)
    - alternativeSuggestions kann das gleiche Wort mehrmals enthalten, wenn es mehrmals im Originaltext vorkommt
